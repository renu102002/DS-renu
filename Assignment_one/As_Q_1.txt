Sorting the Array [3, 8, 1, 6, 4] using Bubble Sort:

Pass 1:
Initiate with the array [3, 8, 1, 6, 4]. Now, let's compare adjacent elements:

    Compare 3 and 8: Since 3 < 8, no swap needed.
    Compare 8 and 1: Swap them as 8 > 1: [3, 1, 8, 6, 4].
    Compare 8 and 6: Swap them as 8 > 6: [3, 1, 6, 8, 4].
    Compare 8 and 4: Swap them as 8 > 4: [3, 1, 6, 4, 8].

After Pass 1: [3, 1, 6, 4, 8]

Pass 2:
Continue the process for the remaining unsorted elements:

    Compare 3 and 1: Swap them as 3 > 1: [1, 3, 6, 4, 8].
    Compare 3 and 6: No swap needed.
    Compare 6 and 4: Swap them as 6 > 4: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8].

After Pass 2: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

Pass 3:
Repeat the process:

    Compare 1 and 3: No swap needed.
    Compare 3 and 4: No swap needed.
    Compare 4 and 6: No swap needed.

After Pass 3: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

Pass 4:
Repeat the process:

    Compare 1 and 3: No swap needed.

After Pass 4: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

Pass 5:
No swaps needed as the array is already sorted.

After Pass 5: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8]

The sorted array is [1, 3, 4, 6, 8].
