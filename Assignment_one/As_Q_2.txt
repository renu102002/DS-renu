Bubble Sort Algorithm Step-by-Step for the Unsorted Array [7, 1, 4, 9, 2]:

Intermediate: Trace the Bubble Sort

Pass 1:

Commence with the array [7, 1, 4, 9, 2]. Compare adjacent elements:

    Compare 7 and 1: Swap them as 7 > 1: [1, 7, 4, 9, 2].
    Compare 7 and 4: Swap them as 7 > 4: [1, 4, 7, 9, 2].
    Compare 7 and 9: No swap needed.
    Compare 9 and 2: Swap them as 9 > 2: [1, 4, 7, 2, 9].

After Pass 1: [1, 4, 7, 2, 9]

Pass 2:

Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted elements:

    Compare 1 and 4: No swap needed.
    Compare 4 and 7: No swap needed.
    Compare 7 and 2: Swap them as 7 > 2: [1, 4, 2, 7, 9].

After Pass 2: [1, 4, 2, 7, 9]

Pass 3:

Repeat the process:

    Compare 1 and 4: No swap needed.
    Compare 4 and 2: Swap them as 4 > 2: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9].

After Pass 3: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]

Pass 4:

Repeat the process:

    Compare 1 and 2: No swap needed.

After Pass 4: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]

Pass 5:

No swaps needed as the array is already sorted.

After Pass 5: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]

The sorted array is [1, 2, 4, 7, 9].
